⚙️ Distributionally Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Equity-Aware Microgrid Operations 🌍⚡

Distributionally-Robust-Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Equity-Aware-Microgrid-Operations is an advanced research framework that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and equity-aware control to enable fair, resilient, and efficient energy management in smart microgrids.

The project pioneers a novel approach where autonomous agents — representing distributed energy resources (DERs), prosumers, and utility operators — collaboratively optimize energy distribution, pricing, and load balancing under uncertainty and fairness constraints.

🧩 Abstract

Modern microgrids face the dual challenge of managing stochastic renewable energy and ensuring fair energy access across users.
Traditional optimization methods often fail under uncertain demand, supply volatility, and social inequities.

This project proposes a Distributionally Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DR-MARL) framework that:

Optimizes long-term energy efficiency under uncertain renewable generation and demand.

Ensures equity-aware allocation among heterogeneous participants.

Uses distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to handle worst-case uncertainty in reward distributions.

Enables decentralized, cooperative decision-making through multi-agent learning.

🚀 Key Contributions

🧠 Distributionally Robust MARL: Incorporates DRO into MARL to ensure stability under uncertain dynamics.

⚖️ Equity-Aware Objectives: Balances efficiency with fairness across agents (e.g., low-income households, industrial users).

🌤️ Renewable Integration: Models stochastic solar, wind, and storage components for real-world conditions.

🔁 Dynamic Pricing & Load Balancing: Learns adaptive energy pricing to stabilize the grid.

🕹️ Multi-Agent Coordination: Decentralized agents collaborate via policy gradients or actor-critic architectures.

🧮 Scalable Simulations: Supports large-scale simulations of distributed microgrid networks.
